This project contains Playwright API tests for the JSONPlaceholder service.

## Installation

Use `npm ci` to install all dependencies exactly as defined in `package-lock.json` and install the browsers required by Playwright:

```bash
npm ci
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

## Running the tests

Execute the full test suite using:

```bash
npm test
```

This command runs the tests located in `src/tests` and generates an HTML report under `playwright-report/`.

Run tests for specific HTTP methods by listing them after the `test` command.
Methods can be separated with spaces or commas. Examples:

```bash
npm test get
npm test post get
npm test post,get,patch
```

Tests may also be filtered by API route. Prefix the route with `/` and provide
one or more routes separated by spaces or commas:

```bash
npm test /posts
npm test /posts /comments
npm test /posts,/comments,/users
```

## Test structure

All specifications live in `src/tests` and are grouped by HTTP method.
The provided script also allows running tests grouped by route.

## Assumptions and notes

Additional details about the overall approach and assumptions can be found in [`docs/testStrategy.md`](docs/testStrategy.md).

## Test data

Sample payloads and routes used by the tests are located under the `config/` directory. Their purpose and structure are described in [`docs/testStrategy.md`](docs/testStrategy.md).

## Limitations and known issues

Any current limitations are documented in [`docs/testStrategy.md`](docs/testStrategy.md). Known bugs discovered during testing are tracked in [`docs/bugReports.md`](docs/bugReports.md).
